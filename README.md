# Free Body Diagram Calculator

This is a simple project with the aim of solving physics based free body diagrams using numpy. Eventually the goal is for there to be a CLI REPL using cmd2 and a GUI probably using qt.

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
